  There are many great README templates available on GitHub;however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this one. I wanted to create a README template which satisfies the project.
  
Here's why:

- A project that solves a problem and helps others.
- One shouldn't be doing the same task over and over like creating a README from scratch.
- You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So i'll be  adding more in the near future.You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

<!--About the Project-->
  
## About The Project

QUEV is a flutter application which uses firebase to sign in users and create a new account. With the help of GOOGLE's MAP api it is able to display a map of your current location and the EV charging stations are marked on it. Tap any of the charging station points to see a shortest route to it. This projects aims at making a way to increse awareness about using more EV's thus helping in reducing pollution caused by normal vehicles.
